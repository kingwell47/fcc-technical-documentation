            The Pokédex is a handheld electronic encyclopedia device; one which
            is capable of recording and retaining information of the various
            Pokémon of the world. In order to accomplish Professor Oak's goal of
            a complete Pokémon database, the Pokédex is designed to find and
            record data on each Pokémon the Trainer meets. Pokémon are added to
            the Pokédex simply by encountering them in battle or, sometimes, by
            seeing a picture of the Pokémon. However, detailed entries are not
            recorded until the player obtains the Pokémon, such as through
            catching, evolving, breeding, gifts, or trades.

            The main feature of any Pokédex are the entries on each individual
            Pokémon, which provide details that would otherwise be unexplored in
            the games. Complete entries can only be seen for captured Pokémon,
            while uncaptured Pokémon only have limited information.

            In Generation I's Pokédex <code>(model HANDY505)</code>, the entries
            are simple and each individual section can be accessed directly from
            the listing. The first, and main option—"Data"—includes an image of
            the Pokémon, its number, name, category, height, weight, and a short
            blurb. The second option—"Cry"—does not open a new screen; selecting
            it simply plays the Pokémon's cry. The last option—"Area"—displays
            the map, along with flashing indicators at each location where the
            selected Pokémon can be found; in cases where the Pokémon is not
            available in the wild, is only available once, or can only be found
            by fishing or in the Unknown Dungeon, the message "Area Unknown"
            will be displayed over the center of the map instead. Pokémon Yellow
            allows players to print entries using the Game Boy Printer.

            Generation II's Pokédex <code>(model HANDY808)</code> retains the
            same elements as its predecessor, while adding the Pokémon's
            footprint to the information and, like Yellow, allows players to
            print entries. Unlike Generation I, selecting a Pokémon displays the
            entry in a new screen from which the other sections can be selected.
            This became the norm for subsequent generations. International
            versions also have a "Page" button for long Pokédex entries (in
            Generation I, player simply had to press A button instead); Japanese
            versions did not have multi-page Pokédex entries.
          </p>
          <p>
            In these games, entries that would normally display "Area Unknown"
            on the map simply display an unmarked map.

          <p>
            Generation III's Pokédex did not add anything to the main entry;
            however, Cry was given its own page, which displays the sound wave
            as it played. In addition, the Area section was changed to highlight
            locations instead of just marking them and can now display the
            locations of Pokémon obtainable by fishing. A Size section was
            added, which displays silhouettes of the Pokémon and the player
            character side by side. In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire only, there is
            a Page button to switch between pages of multi-page Pokédex entries.
          </p>
          <p>
            FireRed and LeafGreen's Pokédex <code>(model HANDY909)</code>
            displays entries in a much different format from Ruby, Sapphire and
            Emerald. It was the first Pokédex to actually display a Pokémon's
            type in its entry, as well as its menu sprite. However, the Cry
            visuals were removed. Entries for Kanto Pokémon were taken from
            Red/Green for FireRed and Red/Blue for LeafGreen. Johto Pokémon
            entries were taken from Silver for FireRed and Gold for LeafGreen.
            Additionally, in the international versions, it is the first Pokédex
            to show long Pokédex entries in full, instead of splitting them into
            two pages. This was carried over to later games, including Emerald.

          <p>
            Generation IV's Pokédex <code>(model HANDY910)</code> added numerous
            features, but of FireRed and LeafGreen's changes, it kept only type.
            Area now changes its highlight color depending on whether a Pokémon
            is found normally or exclusively using Honey, and the player can
            view the differences between morning, day and night, with the
            default being the current time. Cry's display returned, with a bar
            display in addition to the wave display, and the ability to modify
            the cry via Chorus/Pan, Reverb/Filter and Loop. Weight was added to
            the Size section, which puts the Pokémon and the player character on
            either side of a balance scale. A new Forms section allows players
            to see gender and form differences within species, but only for
            forms they have already seen. Males and females of all Pokémon with
            differing gender are shown separately under in the Forms section
            even if there is no visible gender difference. For a small list of
            Pokémon, if the player obtains a Pokémon from another country, they
            can change the language of that Pokémon's entry after meeting
            Meister. In Platinum, this function was expanded to all Pokémon,
            although it still requires Meister to update the Pokédex.
          </p>
          <p>
            HeartGold and SoulSilver changed the formatting again, now
            displaying the list on the lower screen and the actual entry on the
            top screen. Cry's page was again removed. By selecting "view
            details", players can view Area, Size and Forms. Area no longer
            defaults to the current time or differentiated for Honey due to it
            no longer being a mechanic, Size now utilized both screens to
            display both Height and Weight at the same time, and Forms added a
            Compare option to see different forms side by side instead of having
            to scroll between them. Entries for Johto and Kanto Pokémon were
            taken from Gold for HeartGold and Silver for SoulSilver. Players can
            collect foreign Pokédex entries without the need to update their
            Pokédex. Also, while artwork shows a pink Pokédex for females, the
            in-game interface does not reflect this.

        <header>Generation V</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The Generation V Pokédex is similar to the Pokédex from Pokémon
            Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. It is displayed as a list on the right
            side of the lower screen with the selected Pokémon's sprite
            occupying the left side. Most of its functions are also similar to
            Generation IV's. Instead of showing the time of day that a Pokémon
            can be caught, as in Generation IV, the Pokédex shows the seasons in
            which it can be found. Areas in which the Pokémon can be found flash
            red, and touching an area will show the methods by which it can be
            caught (walking in tall grass, surfing, or fishing). The height and
            weight comparison feature has been removed, but a section showing
            form differences and a search feature are added by Cedric Juniper
            when the player visits Mistralton City. The form difference section
            will now show Shiny Pokémon as well as form differences. The last
            sprite selected will become the one displayed in the main entry. The
            ability to collect foreign Pokédex entries now only applies to the
            first 493 Pokémon, but the player can now also collect Korean
            Pokédex entries. The cry page has been added again as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Black 2 and White 2, after defeating Cheren for the first time,
            Bianca will upgrade the player's Pokédex with the Habitat List,
            showing which Pokémon the player has already seen in the selected
            location, either normally, by finding in the water or via fishing
            rod (the latter two available later). If all Pokémon available in
            that place that are available via one of these three ways are seen
            (such as Purrloin and Patrat for tall grass on Route 19), the
            reference to the location in such way is marked with a Poké
            Ball-like stamp; after catching all Pokémon that are found via one
            of these three ways in current place, it gets marked with a colored
            Poké Ball-like stamp.

            In all four games, extra Pokédex skins can also be downloaded
            through the Pokémon Global Link. There was a total of seven
            downloadable skins, but only a maximum of five skins have been made
            available for each gender of the player:

        <article>
          <p>
            The Generation VI Pokédex is card-shaped and has a holographic
            center that is visible when the two ends are separated. It is also
            separated into three categories: Central Kalos, Coastal Kalos, and
            Mountain Kalos, and each category has a different icon in the
            Pokédex menu. The Coastal Pokédex is represented by a blue stripe on
            the left side of a pentagon, the Central Pokédex is represented by a
            white stripe down the middle of a pentagon, and the Mountain Pokédex
            is represented by a red stripe on the right side of a pentagon. The
            symbol for the National Pokédex is a Poké Ball.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the player obtains a Pokémon that was created in Generation VI,
            the symbol in the Pokédex indicating it has been caught is a
            combination of the three Kalos Pokédex symbols: a pentagon with
            vertical blue, white, and red stripes. This resembles the flag of
            France, the region on which Kalos is based. If a Pokémon is
            transferred from a previous generation, the symbol will instead be a
            Poké Ball. The latter symbol can be updated to the former symbol if
            the player obtains a Pokémon of that species originating from
            Generation VI. If all Pokémon are obtained from Generation VI games,
            the Pokédex will be marked with a crown on the selection screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the National Pokédex, there are color codes used to represent
            Pokémon introduced in each generation: red for Generation I, yellow
            for II, green for III, blue for IV, pink for V, and silver for VI.
            Like in Generation V, players may choose the default entry image for
            each Pokémon species, as long as they have seen that gender,
            coloration, or form of that species before. Like in previous games,
            acquiring Pokémon from foreign-language games will unlock the
            ability to view entries in those languages, so long as the player
            owns or has owned a Pokémon from that language. This time, all
            Pokémon entries can be obtained, allowing for both Generation V and
            VI entries for the first time.

            The Generation VII Pokédex consists of a device specially-designed
            to be inhabited by a Rotom, an innovation that gives the Pokédex its
            own personality and is intended as a new way for humans and Pokémon
            to communicate. In addition to a standard Pokédex function, the
            Rotom Pokédex includes a detailed map that can point out nearby
            locations of interest, and remind the player of the next objective
            based on recent conversations with NPCs. The Rotom Pokédex is a rare
            model even in the Alola region where it was created.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the Kalos Pokédex, the Alola Pokédex is divided into several
            categories, with a section for each of the four main islands of the
            region. Unlike the Kalos Pokédex, Pokémon in Alola can be found in
            more than one section of the Pokédex. In addition to the number of
            Pokémon seen and owned, it also displays the total percentage of
            Pokédex completion. Event-exclusive forms, regional forms and Mega
            Evolutions have separate entries from the rest of their species.
            Unlike previous generations, a Pokémon's gender is only shown
            separately under the Forms section if there is a visible gender
            difference. The player can also scan QR codes to add Pokémon they
            haven't encountered yet to the Pokédex, allowing them to check the
            Pokémon's location in Alola.

            The Galar Pokédex in Generation VIII is an application Sonia
            installs in the player's Rotom Phone after she is met for the first
            time. Additionally, when the player first arrives in the Isle of
            Armor or Crown Tundra, a doctor will install the regional Pokédex
            for that area on the player's Rotom Phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once per day, the Pokédex will give the player a recommended place
            to look for Pokémon to complete their Pokédex; these recommendations
            globally increase the encounter rates of the recommended species,
            excluding wanderer and curry encounters.[1] When in an area where
            the recommended species can be encountered, the bonus has 50% chance
            to activate and attempt to spawn a recommended species, with a 25%
            chance for each of the 4 recommended species slots being selected.
            This fails if it lands on a blank recommendation slot, or a species
            that doesn't spawn in the current encounter pool, in which case it
            defaults to the normal encounter pool.[2] This bonus only affects
            the first form of a recommended species, determined by the index
            number of the form.[3] As an example, Sinistea being recommended in
            the Old Cemetery would also boost the encounter rate of Sinistea in
            Glimwood Tangle, but only for Phony Form Sinistea, not Antique Form.

            In Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, the Sinnoh Pokédex visually
            and functionally works how it did in Diamond and Pearl, however, it
            was the interface was changed for optimization on a TV rather than
            the Nintendo DS's dual screen layout. The player can change the
            filters put on cries using the gyro sensors on their controllers, as
            opposed to a touch screen. Pressing the + button on a Pokémon's
            entry will change their footprint from a single footprint, to all
            footprints if available, showing whether a Pokémon is bipedal or
            quadrupedal. Form comparison and foreign Pokédex entries are built
            into this Pokédex, as opposed to being unlockable like the original
            Diamond and Pearl.

            The Hisui Pokédex in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, due to taking place in
            the past, appears to be the least advanced out of all current
            Pokédex models, simplying being a book and not containing any
            technology. The player receives their Pokédex from Cyllene when they
            join the Survey Corps of the Galaxy Team. Like the Pokédex in
            previous games, Hisui's features different sections of Pokémon
            organization by separating them by area or within the entire Hisui
            region. When obtained from Professor Laventon in the Crimson
            Mirelands, the player has the ability to open an Unown Pokédex by
            pressing the Y button when the Pokédex's cover is shown. A majority
            of the Pokémon in this Pokédex are shared with the Pokédex in
            Platinum, as both games take place in the Sinnoh Region.

            The Paldea Regional Pokédex takes on the appearance of a bookshelf,
            with the Pokémon's entries being books.

          <p>The original Pokédex had no search function.</p>
          <p>
            In Generation II, the ability to search for Pokémon by type was
            added, as well as the ability to sort by New Pokédex mode, Old
            Pokédex mode, A to Z mode and Unown Mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Ruby and Sapphire, the search function was expanded to allow
            searches by name and color. Players were also given the option to
            order Pokémon by Heaviest, Lightest, Tallest, or Smallest. Two modes
            were available, Hoenn and National. National mode was unlocked via a
            trade with Kanto or Orre, or, in Emerald, entering the Hall of Fame.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in FireRed and LeafGreen, the search function was dropped
            altogether, instead choosing to expand the sort functions by adding
            lists of Pokémon by type and habitat. Heaviest and Tallest orders
            were also removed. National Mode was unlocked by having obtained 60
            Pokémon in the Pokédex, entering the Hall of Fame and completing the
            Sevii Island's sidequest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generation IV brought the Search function back, as well as Heaviest
            and Tallest orders. Habitat was dropped. Searches could now be
            conducted by Form, but not by Color. The two Pokédex modes were
            Sinnoh and National. National mode was unlocked by seeing every
            Pokémon in the Sinnoh Dex.
          </p>
          <p>
            HeartGold and SoulSilver added the ability to search by Height and
            Weight (instead of simply sorting by them), and also allowed search
            by Area (Johto, Kanto, or Unknown). National Mode was added by
            talking with Professor Oak in the S.S. Aqua port in Olivine City
            after entering the Hall of Fame.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Generation V, the Pokédex for Black, White, Black 2, and White 2
            allows the player to search for Pokémon with the following criteria:
            Order (Number, A to Z, Heavy to Light, Light to Heavy, Tall to
            Short, and Short to Tall), Name (All letters of the alphabet), Type,
            Color, which was returned to the search after being dropped in
            Generation IV, and Form. Unlike in HeartGold and SoulSilver, the
            ability to search for Pokémon by area was dropped. By changing the
            Pokédex type, the player can search for Pokémon native to the Unova
            Region or from other regions, but in order to search for other
            Pokémon, the player must have first been obtained the National
            Pokédex upgrade from Cedric Juniper after the defeat of
            GhetsisBW/IrisB2W2. After obtaining the upgrade, the player can
            switch the Pokédex type from the National Pokédex to the Unova
            Pokédex at will by simply tapping "SELECT" in the lower portion of
            the touch screen or by pressing the SELECT button on the DS System.
            In Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, it is not possible to use the Search
            Function in the Habitat List mode of the Pokédex.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pokémon X and Y, the ability to search for Pokémon that are not
            caught was added. Furthermore, only the currently set form of a
            Pokémon will be considered by the Pokédex when sorting and
            searching. All other forms will be ignored, and the form setting
            will not change to make the Pokémon match the search criteria. If
            the form is changed in the entry and the Pokémon either no longer
            matches the search criteria or belongs in a different place in the
            list, its entry will vanish or move according to its new form. The
            regional Pokédex is divided into three categories, each with
            separate Pokémon and search functions: Central Kalos (the first one
            unlocked), Coastal Kalos (unlocked by Sina and Dexio upon entering
            Route 8), and Mountain Kalos (unlocked by Sina and Dexio in the gate
            between Coumarine City and Route 13, after beating Ramos). The
            National Pokédex upgrade is obtained from Dexio after entering the
            Hall of Fame, upon entering Lumiose Station.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire kept all the search features
            from X and Y, with some new additions. This time, all forms of a
            Pokémon registered will be taken in account when sorting and
            searching, even if they aren't the currently set form. There is also
            an option to search for Pokémon whose Mega Evolution form or Shiny
            appearance have been registered.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pokémon Sun and Moon, the Pokédex is divided into 4 Island
            Pokédexes, which feature the Pokémon found in each island of Alola
            (thus sharing species). Combined, they form the Alola Pokédex, which
            gathers all the Pokémon present in the Island Pokédexes, plus some
            others, like Legendary Pokémon and Ultra Beasts. The search/sorting
            function is only present in the Alola Pokédex proper. In addition to
            the features available in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, a new
            option is present, that allows to search for Pokémon whose Alolan
            Form has been seen. There is no National Pokédex mode in these
            games.

          <p>
            There are various mechanisms to evaluate the number of Pokémon in
            the Pokédex. These mechanisms will display a quote relating to the
            number of Pokémon seen or caught, often including a hint to the
            player of how to progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all games in which Professor Oak appears, he will evaluate the
            player's Pokédex according to the number of Pokémon they have
            caught. In games which feature the National Pokédex, Oak's
            evaluation takes this into account, but in a different way according
            to the game:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, Oak gives specific quotes
              according to the number of Pokémon caught in the regional Pokédex,
              and a general quote according to whether they have completed the
              National Pokédex or not
            </li>
            <li>
              In Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, Oak will only comment on
              the National Pokédex, according to the number of Pokémon caught
            </li>
            <li>
              In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, Oak will comment on both the
              regional and National Pokédexes, according to the number of
              Pokémon caught
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In Hoenn-based games, Professor Birch will evaluate the player's
            Pokédex:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, Birch comments on the regional
              Pokédex, according to the number of Pokémon caught, but only after
              Wally catches a Ralts. He will also give the number of Pokémon
              caught in the National dex, after it is obtained
            </li>
            <li>
              In Pokémon Emerald, it works the same as Pokémon Ruby and
              Sapphire, except that Birch will start to evaluate after the
              player gets the PokéNav
            </li>
            <li>
              In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Birch will comment on
              the regional Pokédex according to the number of Pokémon seen, and
              the national Pokédex according to the number caught
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, as well as Oak evaluating
            the National dex as noted above, Professor Rowan will also evaluate
            the regional dex according to the number seen.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, White 2, Professor Juniper will
            evaluate the regional Pokédex according to both seen and caught
            Pokémon, while Cedric Juniper will evaluate the National Pokédex.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pokémon X and Y, Professor Sycamore will evaluate all three
            regional Pokédexes according to seen Pokémon, and the National
            Pokédex according to caught Pokémon.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon, the Rotom Pokédex
            itself will evaluate according to the number of Pokémon seen in each
            of the four islands as well as in Alola as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pokémon Sword and Shield, the Rotom Phone itself will evaluate
            according to the number of Pokémon seen in the main area of Galar,
            the Isle of Armor, and the Crown Tundra.

          <p>
            Completing the Pokédex is a common goal of Trainers and carries with
            it much esteem due to its difficulty, which has gradually escalated
            due to the fact that around 100 new Pokémon are introduced with each
            new generation. However, this is mitigated to a degree by new
            features added to the games, such as Wi-Fi and the Global Trade
            System in Generation IV, and a less restrictive trading system
            (between PC boxes instead of only active teams) in Generation V. The
            exclusion of event Pokémon as a requirement for completing the
            Pokédex also makes it possible for people with no access to event
            distributions to complete the Pokédex.
          </p>
          <p>
            The in-game rewards are usually a congratulations from the
            director's avatar and a diploma, usually one for completing the
            regional Pokédex and one for the National Pokédex. In Emerald, the
            player could choose from one of the Johto starter Pokémon for
            completing the Hoenn Dex. The completion of the Pokédex also usually
            allows the player to upgrade their Trainer Card. Also, in Pokémon
            Black and White, the diploma will appear on the shelf in the
            player's bedroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Generations I to III, the completion of the regional Pokédex is
            tracked by how many Pokémon the player has caught. However, in
            Pokémon Diamond and Pearl and Platinum, the regional Pokédex is
            tracked simply by how many Pokémon the player has seen. In Pokémon
            HeartGold and SoulSilver, though, it again registers only Pokémon
            that have been caught. In Generation V, though Professor Juniper
            originally evaluates the player's regional Pokédex based on the
            Pokémon the player has seen, they may still only receive a diploma
            after having caught all regional Pokémon. Completion of the National
            Pokédex is always based only on the number of Pokémon caught.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pokémon Black and White 2, the system is revised to give the
            player more in-game recognition of their achievements. Once all the
            Pokémon in the Unova Pokédex have been seen, Professor Juniper
            presents the player a Permit, allowing access to the Nature
            Preserve. Once the player has caught all of the Pokémon in the Unova
            Pokédex, Professor Juniper will give the player an Oval Charm which
            increases the chances of finding Pokémon Eggs at the Pokémon Day
            Care. When the player completes the National Pokédex, Professor
            Juniper gives the player a Shiny Charm, which increases the chances
            of encountering and hatching Shiny Pokémon.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pokémon X and Y, Professor Sycamore will reward the player with
            an Oval Charm upon seeing all Pokémon in the Kalos Pokédex, except
            for Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, and Mewtwo. Upon completing the
            National Pokédex, the player will receive a Shiny Charm from
            Sycamore.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Professor Birch will
            reward the player with an Oval Charm upon seeing all Pokémon in the
            Hoenn Pokédex, except for Jirachi. Should the player complete the
            National Pokédex, Birch will also reward the player with a Shiny
            Charm. Also in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the diplomas given by
            the director can be displayed in the player's Secret Base and can be
            viewed in the same way when obtaining it from the director. Other
            players visiting the secret base cannot see the full image on the
            diplomas, but instead will view it as an "impressive certificate".
